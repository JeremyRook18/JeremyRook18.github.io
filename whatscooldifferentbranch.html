Its ok, really it is :) Its a hard thing to get used to, its easy to care, but hard to put into practice. 

If you make a mistake, all good! Just move on. Or a quick sorry and move on. The LAST thing I want is for people to distrupt the flow because of me, or make it awkward or create a scene. 

I'm more grateful that your including me and not be on edge when I'm around.
